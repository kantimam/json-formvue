# Formvue Json

Formvue is a Vue 2.x component library that generates dynamic forms from a provided JSON schema.
It is tailored to be used with another Typo3 library "extended formframework" but you can easily translate any configuration to the required format.

# Setup

- Preferably install Typo3 and Extended Form Framework before.
- Prepare your front end to be able to use es6 features and Vue. You can use webpack for that.
- Make sure you are using Node version >= 12.18.3 (check out nvm for using a certain Node version).
- Install the newest version of formvue-json via npm.
